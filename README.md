# Health Diagnosis Plugin - AI-based Plant Disease Detection

## Overview
The Health Diagnosis Plugin is a WordPress plugin combined with a Vue.js frontend to detect plant diseases using artificial intelligence. This plugin leverages Naive UI, a Vue 3 Component Library, and TypeScript to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience. The backend is developed in PHP to integrate smoothly with WordPress, allowing the use of shortcodes to embed the plugin on any page of your website.
